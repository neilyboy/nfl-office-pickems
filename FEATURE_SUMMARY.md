# Week Navigation Feature - Complete ✅

## What Was Built

### User Features
**Week Navigation on `/picks`:**
- ← → buttons to browse all 18 NFL weeks
- Clear visual indicators:
  - 🟢 **Current Week** badge - the active NFL week
  - 🔵 **Past** badge - completed weeks (read-only)
  - ⚪ **Future** badge - upcoming weeks (editable)
- Smart lock system:
  - Past weeks: locked, view-only
  - Current week: countdown timer, locks at first game
  - Future weeks: fully editable until week starts

**User Experience:**
- Review past weeks to see picks and results
- Make picks for next week in advance
- Edit future picks anytime before lock
- All picks auto-save per week

### Admin Features
**Admin Picks Management (`/admin/picks`):**
- Same week navigation interface
- View any user's picks for any week
- Edit picks for any user in any week
- No restrictions - full data control
- Can enter historical or future data

### API Enhancements
Both endpoints now support optional `?week=N` parameter:
- `/api/games/current-week?week=3` - get Week 3 games
- `/api/admin/picks?week=7` - get all picks for Week 7
- Returns both `week` (requested) and `currentWeek` (actual)
- Validates week range (1-18)

## Testing Results ✅

```bash
# API Tests
✅ Week 5 (current): Returns games and currentWeek=5
✅ Week 3 (past): Returns games and currentWeek=5
✅ Week 0 (invalid): Returns error "Week must be between 1 and 18"
✅ Week 19 (invalid): Returns error "Week must be between 1 and 18"
✅ Week 1 (boundary): Returns games successfully
✅ Week 18 (boundary): Returns games successfully
```

## How It Works

### User Flow Example
1. User logs in → lands on current Week 5
2. Clicks ← button → navigates to Week 4 (past, locked)
3. Reviews their picks and results
4. Clicks → twice → navigates to Week 6 (future)
5. Makes picks for next week
6. Saves and leaves
7. Can return anytime before Week 6 starts to edit

### Admin Flow Example
1. Admin navigates to `/admin/picks`
2. Uses ← → to view Week 2
3. Selects a user who forgot to make picks
4. Clicks "Edit Picks"
5. Enters their picks (admin can edit past weeks)
6. Saves - user now has picks for Week 2

### Technical Architecture
```
User clicks ← or → button
    ↓
setWeek(newWeek) updates state
    ↓
useEffect triggers on week change
    ↓
fetchWeekGames() or fetchPicksData()
    ↓
API call with ?week=N parameter
    ↓
Returns games + currentWeek
    ↓
UI updates with new week data
    ↓
Lock logic determines edit permissions
```
