# Week Navigation - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive week navigation for both users and admins to view and manage picks across all NFL weeks (1-18).

## Features Implemented

### 1. User Picks Interface (`/picks`)
**Week Navigation UI:**
- ← → chevron buttons to navigate between weeks
- Week 1-18 range with disabled buttons at boundaries
- Visual badges indicating:
  - "Current Week" - for the active NFL week
  - "Past" - for previous weeks
  - "Future" - for upcoming weeks

**Smart Lock Logic:**
- **Past weeks**: Always locked, read-only view
- **Current week**: Locks at first game time
- **Future weeks**: Open for picks until that week starts
- Live countdown timer showing time until lock

**User Experience:**
- Can view past weeks to review their picks and results
- Can make picks for future weeks
- Can edit future week picks until that week locks
- Clear visual feedback about what actions are available

### 2. Admin Picks Management (`/admin/picks`)
**Week Navigation UI:**
- Same ← → navigation as user interface
- Week indicators (Current/Past/Future)
- Disabled during active editing to prevent data loss

**Admin Capabilities:**
- View any week (past, present, or future)
- Edit picks for any user in any week
- No lock restrictions - full control
- See which users have/haven't made picks each week

### 3. API Updates

**`/api/games/current-week` (GET)**
- Accepts optional `week` parameter
- Returns:
  - `week` - requested week
  - `currentWeek` - actual current NFL week
  - `games` - games for requested week

  - `isLocked` - boolean lock status

**`/api/admin/picks` (GET)**

## Technical Notes

### State Management
- Both components track `week` (selected) and `currentWeek` (actual)
- `useEffect` triggers data fetch when week changes
- Loading state prevents navigation spam

### Lock Logic
```typescript
// Past weeks are always locked
if (week < currentWeek) {
  setIsLocked(true);
  setTimeRemaining('Past Week');
  return;
}

// Current week locks at game time
if (diff <= 0) {
  setIsLocked(true);
  setTimeRemaining('Picks Locked');
  return;
}
```

### API Parameter Pattern
```typescript
const url = week > 0 
  ? `/api/games/current-week?week=${week}` 
  : '/api/games/current-week';
```
