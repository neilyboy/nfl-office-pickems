## 🐛 Critical Bugs Fixed (Session History)

### **1. Backup Path Issue**
- **Problem:** Backup failing in Docker (wrong path)
- **Solution:** Auto-detect Docker vs dev environment
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

### **2. Google Fonts Timeout**
- **Problem:** Docker build failing due to Google Fonts fetch timeout
- **Solution:** Removed external font dependency, use system fonts
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

### **3. Auto-Refresh Jumping Weeks**
- **Problem:** Auto-refresh forcing user back to current week while browsing history
- **Solution:** Only auto-refresh when viewing current week
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

### **4. Tiebreaker Logic Bug (CRITICAL)**
- **Problem:** When users tied for winner/loser, tiebreaker searched ALL users instead of just tied users
- **Example:** Week 2: Craig won (14), jerry/don tied for last (11). Tiebreaker picked Craig as loser too!
- **Solution:** Only search `tiedForFirst` or `tiedForLast` arrays when applying tiebreaker
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed in both `/api/standings` and `/api/stats`

### **5. Lunch Tracker Incorrect Counts**
- **Problem:** Stats page showing wrong W-L records
- **Root Cause:** Same as bug #4 - tiebreaker bug caused wrong winners/losers
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed (resolved by bug #4 fix)

### **6. Same Person Winner & Loser**
- **Problem:** When only 1 person made picks, they became both winner and loser
- **Solution:** Skip lunch counting when `winner.id === loser.id`
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### **Core Tables**
- `User` - User accounts with roles
- `Pick` - Individual game picks
- `UserPermissions` - Feature access control
- `SystemBackup` - Backup metadata

### **Relationships**
- User → has many Picks
- User → has one UserPermissions
- All picks cascade delete with user

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Always search within filtered arrays for tiebreakers** - critical logic bug
2. **Auto-refresh should respect user navigation** - UX issue
3. **Docker paths differ from dev** - environment awareness
4. **Google Fonts can timeout** - use local fonts
5. **Reverse proxy detection works great** - `X-Forwarded-Proto`
6. **TypeScript catches bugs early** - worth the setup
7. **Prisma makes database work easy** - great DX
