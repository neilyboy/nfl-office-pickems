3. **Thursday-Monday:** Games play, users watch live scores
4. **Monday Night:** Final game determines weekly winner
5. **Tuesday:** Admin can archive last week's chat
6. **Repeat!**

### Scoring System

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Users shows 0 on admin dashboard
**Solution:** This is normal if no games have completed yet. It will populate once games finish.

### Issue: Picks won't save
**Solution:** Check if picks are locked (lock time shows on picks page). Only admin can edit locked picks.

### Issue: Live scores not updating
**Solution:** Auto-refresh is every 30 seconds. Click "Refresh" button for immediate update.

### Issue: Forgot admin PIN
**Solution:** Check admin password recovery option on login, or reset database and start fresh.

### Issue: Backup fails
**Solution:** Ensure `prisma/data/backups/` directory exists and has write permissions.
