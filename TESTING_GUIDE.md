## üêõ Known Issues / Limitations

### Current Limitations:
1. **No admin pick management** - Admin cannot edit user picks yet
2. **No chat management (admin)** - Admin cannot clear/manage chat yet
3. **No historical data** - Past weeks not accessible yet
4. **No backup/restore** - Database backup feature not implemented
5. **Tooltips missing** - Icon buttons need hover tooltips
6. **No past week chat archives** - Can only see current week chat

### Expected Behavior (Not Bugs):
- **Week 5 picks are locked** - Thursday game already started at 7:15 PM CST
- **Leaderboard shows "No picks yet"** - Need multiple users with picks
- **Some games show 0-0** - Games haven't started yet
- **Only current week visible** - Week navigation not implemented yet

## üìä Test Data Suggestions

```

User 2:
- Username: bob
